This Reverse shell Generator produces a  PowerShell script which obfuscate a SimplePowerShell payload in each execution. in every execution of the script, after user enter LHOST/LPORT, the script generates a SimplePowerShell code, but in an {0/B/F/u/$/c/a/t/3} i.e,string matched  way which (for now), can evade the Windows Defender/RealTimeProtection. Instead of try changing it manually, the script check for 'known' words, and replace them with a random onces. When done, executing the .ps1 file results in a shell on the attacker machine, without victim notice it (process runs background).
The script includes functions to generate random UUIDs and strings, which could be used for obfuscation or unique identification purposes. It also contains a list of commands and words that seem to be related to establishing a TCP connection and executing commands on a remote system via PowerShell. These commands are obfuscated, possibly to evade detection by security systems.
The script uses the logging and tqdm libraries for logging and progress bar functionality, respectively. Colorama is used for colored terminal text output. The threading and subprocess libraries are imported, suggesting potential multi-threading or subprocess execution, although these are not used in the provided code.
